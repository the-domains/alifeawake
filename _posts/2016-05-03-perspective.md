I believe that one of the most profoundly impactful things we can do is gain a little perspective. Our focus has a tendency to naturally narrow, on our accomplishments, our struggles, our pain, and our desires, in such a way that our vision becomes distorted. Nearsightedness is spiritually crippling. Sometimes the solution is more simple than the problem makes it appear. Ready for it?

Stand next to something big.

Seriously.

Get your feet in the sand and look out at the ocean.

Stand at the base of a mountain and look up.

Hang your feet over the edge of the Grand Canyon.

Hike into the woods until you don't see anybody else and look around.

Lay on your front lawn and look up at the stars. Try to count them.

Look out the window 20 minutes before your plane touches down.

For those who insist on staying indoors, rent _Planet Earth_ and watch a few episodes.

Standing on a cliff, looking down of the Pacific Ocean, churning with white-tipped, translucent-blue waves, I was struck by the reality that I am, in fact, a blip. Looking out at waves as far as I could see, I realized that I am looking at a only a fraction of 1% of the Pacific Ocean, which makes up less than half of the ocean water in the world. So, technically, I am actually looking at _less than half_ of a fraction of 1% of the ocean. Still considerably more than enough to make me feel like a blip.

In the face of such enormity, my life suddenly felt very small. My biggest problems seemed silly and insignificant. My accomplishments appeared barely noticeable. In the face of the enormity of this vast body of water, arrogance and pride seemed laughable. I could shake my fist in defiance of their power, yet the waves wouldn't even hear my tiny voice over their roar as they washed me away without even noticing.

Then it struck me. Echoing in the back of my head from some forgotten quiet-time;

"Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand..."

As immeasurably big as this ocean is, the One who created it is immeasurably bigger still.

If you can't find an ocean, a tree, a mountain, or a video store, just read Isaiah 40\.

I thought I couldn't feel any smaller. I was deceived.

My mind raced through Genesis 1, picturing the Father, Son, and Spirit calling existence into existence in a symphony of chaos coming into perfect order. I am so very small.

Suddenly my anger at God for not responding to my prayers they way I believe He should, frustration for not bending to my will and desires, or believing that I know better than He does, seemed preposterous. I am a blip.

However...

This God, _who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and marked off the heavens with a span, enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance _(Isaiah 40:12)...knows me. He knows you. Not just that you exist, but what you think, what you love, what you fear, what you desire. He knows the number of hairs _on_ and every thought _inside_ of your head. You. Me. Blips.

This God not only knows you, but loves you. _Loves_ you. Not some future version of you. Not what you've accomplished. Not what you look like. You. Right now.

God,_"being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ---by grace you have been saved---and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. _(Eph 2:4-9)_"_

Our lack of gratitude for grace is at least partially due to our distorted vision, making ourselves, our accomplishments, and our difficulties appear huge and making God appear small, and as a result, His gift.

The Gospel creates a strange paradox, where the more we become aware of our insignificance, the more confident we feel. Our "blip-ness" is not crippling, but empowering. In spite of the fact that this world is big enough to crush us and not even notice, our Advocate, our King, our Father is immeasurably greater still and works all things for the good of His children! Even entering into His own creation to allow it to crush Him, so that it wouldn't have to crush us.

This blip feels unstoppable.
